# Miscellaneous Work
I decided to include some experimental or just for fun programs here to tinker with in the future. I've included Primes.js that will factor composities and MatrixFill that a friend wanted me to create finding random inverse matrices with only integer values.
## Details
Primes.js simply implements a loop of modular arithmetic. MatrixFill fills a matrix that can specified by the user and calculates if the determinate is 1 or -1 by making use of the code taken from geeksforgeeks [here] (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/determinant-of-a-matrix/). It theoretically will output a matrix whose inverse is all integer values (finding one could be as often as winning the lottery so is not recommended to run).
## Potential Improvements
There could be a much better algorithm for both programs.
## How to Run
It is not recommended to run MatrixFill. One can run Primes by downloading from the repository [here](https://taylorcharleshall.github.io/misc) then running with node or copying and pasting into Dev Tools.
