# Miscellaneous Work
I decided to include some experimental or just for fun programs here to tinker with in the future. I've included Primes.js that will factor composities and MatrixFill.js that a friend wanted me to create finding random inverse matrices with only integer values. The Python code I included are short programs I designed to compute standard deviation, median, and to generate lotto numbers with included odds.
## Details
Primes.js simply implements a loop of modular arithmetic. MatrixFill fills a matrix that can specified by the user and calculates if the determinate is 1 or -1 by making use of the code taken from geeksforgeeks [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/determinant-of-a-matrix/). It theoretically will output a matrix whose inverse is all integer values (finding one could be as often as winning the lottery so is not recommended to run). With the Python programs, I imported the math and random packages making use of list and string functions. 
## Potential Improvements
There could be a much better algorithm for these programs.
## How to Run
It is not recommended to run MatrixFill. One can run Primes by downloading from the repository [here](https://github.com/TaylorCharlesHall/misc) then running with node or copying and pasting into Dev Tools.
